# ERGM

## What you will find here:
In this folder you will find a folder for each ERGM approach we have taken. In each folder are the GOF results, MCML results  (after initial model convergence), the ergm model function we used, the nodes file with the appropriate features, as well as a PDF of the GOF results. If any of these folders is missing some of this information, that means it did not converge. The same edges file used for all of the attemps can be found in this ERGM folder as well as here:

The same dataframe but with the ERGM features we use can be found in this ERGM folder within our shared CDC folder as well as here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ja73pltDoMsl3rwOb3N0ojgzSGNzy4Y/view?usp=drive_link
These features include verification status, low quality, photo sharing, average sentiment, number of retweets total for each user, as well as the quadrant each user is in for each mask-related topic based on their average topic weights.
